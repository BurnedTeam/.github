# Welcome to BurnedTeam
We are an organization composed of Pablo Natera Muñoz (Natera), Raúl Martin-Romo Sánchez (Thander) and Alejandro Barrena Millán (Alexeido) students at the University of Extremadura. Here at BurnedTeam, we work together on class projects and host them on Github repositories.

Our first project, Development of Programs, is a Java application that simulates a cycling race. The application organizes teams, bicycles, stages, cyclists, times, etc.

Currently, we are working on Artificial Intelligences in Python, an AI that must exit a maze in the shortest time possible with the exact number of coins requested. We also have knowledge in C++ and AT&T assembly.
